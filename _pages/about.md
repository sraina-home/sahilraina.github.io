I am Sahil Raina, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Alberta's Alberta School of Business. I study various research topics in finance and economics: politics and finance, venture capital, financial intermediation, and competition and finance. I received my PhD at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business in 2016.
